          The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
          descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived
          from extinct gray wolves, and the gray wolf is the dog's closest
          living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by
          humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more
          than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of
          agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have
          expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the
          ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for
          other canids.

          The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or
          house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only
          domesticated species of the family Felidae. Recent advances in
          archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat
          occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a
          house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding
          human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its
          ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing
          small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick
          reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are
          well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
          crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like
          meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as
          cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
          frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also
          secretes and perceives pheromones.
